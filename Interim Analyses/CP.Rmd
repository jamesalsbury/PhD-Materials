# Looking at stopping for futility instead

# Conditional power

Conditional power is the probability that the final study result will be statistically significant, given the data observed thus far.

This trial looked at trying to reduce the rates of pneumonia in elderly care home residents. 

The primary endpoint was development of first pneumonia. The target sample size was 828 particpiants to detect a 25% reduction in the cumulative 2.5 year first pneumonia rate with internvention relative to control assuming a type I error of 0.05, 80% power

One interim analysis was specified at 2.5 years for efficacy using a H-B stopping boundary of 0.001 with futility assessed by conditional power using 50% power under the current trend as a guideline for considering the trial as futile.
