# Looking at stopping for futility instead

# Conditional power

Conditional power is the probability that the final study result will be statistically significant, given the data observed thus far.

Placebo rate is 35%
They think the ancrod rate is 40%
Want to detect at 95% power
Two-tailed significance of 0.05

n = 600 in total
300 in each

Interim analysis was done after 670 patients were followed up for 3 months
0.0007 for efficacy
Futility based on conditional power
If conditional power was less than 30%, the trial would be stopped.
